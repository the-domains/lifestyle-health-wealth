On my normal morning 12.5 kilometer run I seem to see the new trends of bicycles passing me on a daily occurence being 2016 I see the importance of a more green environmental friendly source of transportation.

the latest is this amazing state of the art that whizzed past me a middle age gentleman like myself knows the importance of balancing health especially when we are not to far off from being half a century old, do you get the importance of it all. So I did a little online search and I found it... The Cube Urban Street folded bike. The ultimate argument solved about taking up cycling; "I don't have any room for a bicycle." So here is a folding bike concept I would give short shrift to that excuse, were it ever to transition into a real world commercial product. Gregor Dauth, a student at the Coburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany has worked with Cube bikes to develop his Urban Street Concept Bike. Gregor reckons you can fold up his full size bike to fit in a Smart car. Continue folding it like the blades of a Swiss Army Knife and he says the frame willl fit into a rucksack. With a bike well compacted this design even though it is just under a decade old... show you how well in advanced are the designer's of todays bicycles such as Gregor.
